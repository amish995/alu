# 8 Bit ALU written in Mojo/Lucid

An 8 bit ALU implementation with manual switch based inputs instead of the automatic checking that the master branch deals with.

# Getting started

Load the .mojo file in Mojo IDE and build followed by upload to a connected Mojo board. Then control the switches to observe the working of the ALU.
